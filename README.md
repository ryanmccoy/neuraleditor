# NEURALEDITOR

# My wandering, disorganized, overly ambitious attempt to build a mutli-agent Editorial Framework for a friend who is struggling to find a quality editor (that doesn't cost an arm and a lef) for his Manuscript.
# I am confident this can be done, but to do it alone with a full time job ultimately turned out to be nearly impossible (at least on the time line he needs)
# Nothing here is ultimately really usable,  just a collection of experiments with NLP models and attempts at orchestrating low-level editorial workloads using OpenAI's models. A ton of research is left unexplored in my Obsidian Canvas. Putting # this out in the ether because why not. Maybe someone sees it and likes the idea enough to collaborate. Otherwise... probably going to sit here collecting dust until I am rich enough to scale into it, or someone else beats me to it.
