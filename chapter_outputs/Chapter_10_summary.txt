Two whole days had passed and Mrs. Porter had not inquired for his state of health. Nurse Vera Deane was called on the telephone by a police officer. Her handbag was found intact in her trunk and she was able to give it to the inspector. It was the first time in her life she had lost a handbag and she had never lost it. Millicent said she didn't want to leave the car or talk to anyone. Vera waited until convinced that the limousine must have driven off, then, tossing the blue cape with its small picturesque red cross about her shoulders, walked swiftly past the garage.
